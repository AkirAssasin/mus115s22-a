# Parallel Fourths, Fifths and Octaves

- when too much consonance becomes a problem
- when a perfect-ish interval "walks" to the same interval
  - e.g. `CG` to `DA`, `CC` to `DD`, `CF` to `DG`
  - starts to sound uncanny, especially when done in succession
    - even when they are all "perfect" individually
    - e.g. `CC`, `DD`, `EE`, ... will sound uncomfortable
  - this problem can sometimes be masked by a foreground melody
    - becomes more prominent when played alone, or as foreground
