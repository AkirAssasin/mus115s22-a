# Holiday Notes

Notes from watching YouTube videos on music theory every day during the holidays.

## Day 1. [A Beginner's Guide to Music Theory](https://youtu.be/n2z02J4fJwg)

- **tempo**
  - tempo is measured in beats per minute (BPM)
  - time signature $\tfrac{a}{b}$ = 1 bar has $a$ beats of length $\tfrac{1}{b}$
    - I guess we'll find out the impact of this later on
- **notes**
  - a pitch and duration
  - `A4` is the note of `A` in octave 4
- **frequency**
  - depends on the tuning system used
  - modern western uses [12-tone equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament)
    - typically tuned to A440 (`A4` tuned to 440Hz)
- **octave**
  - an octave starts with `C`, has 12 semitones
  - 12-equal means each semitone is a $\sqrt[12]{2}$ step on a logarithmic scale
    - frequency of next note $f_{i + 1} = (\sqrt[12]{2})f_i$
    - frequency of next octave $f_{i + 12} = 2f_i$
- **scale**
  - common types: major and minor
  - has a root note
  - `C` major scale is a major scale with a root note of `C`
- **chords**
  - a group of notes played together
  - triad: 1st, 3rd, 5th notes in some scale

## Day 2. [The Circle of Fifths - How to Actually Use It](https://youtu.be/d1aJ6HixSe0)

- **perfect fifth**
  - two notes, with 5 semitones in between
- **circle of fifths**
  - the next note is a perfect fifth from the previous
  - starts from `C`, followed by `G`, `D`, `A`, `E`, `B`, `F♯`, `D♭`, `A♭`, `E♭`, `B♭`, `F` and back to `C`
- **and more...**

## Day 2. [How Chord Progressions Work](https://youtu.be/fCNuaubi95Q)

- I still don't know how chord progressions work
- **chords with key context**
  - the 7 notes of the key's scale form the 7 chords
    - major (`K`), minor (`k`) or diminished (`k°`) chord
    - **key of `K` major**
      - `K = I`, `ii`, `iii`, `IV`, `V`, `vi`, `vii°`
    - **key of `k` minor**
      - `k = i`, `ii°`, `III`, `iv`, `v`, `VI`, `VII`
  - **deriving chords in key**
    - example: 7th chord in the key of `C` major
    - get the 7th key, which is `B`
    - get the 3rd and 5th intervals of `B` in the key of `C` major, which is `D` and `F`
    - `B D F` is the 7th chord, which is also the `B` diminished triad
- **chord without key context**
  - `C` major 7th = `C` major triad + 7th note of `C` major
    - which is `C E G` + `B`
  - not sure if there is a more distinct terminology for differentiating (a lack of) keys

## Day 3. [Major, Minor, Diminished Scales](https://youtu.be/GrqZnRs6-xI)

- **scales**
  - a set of notes with predefined intervals between notes
  - notation here is counting up from the first note
  - major scales: `2 2 1 2 2 2 1`
  - diminished scales: `2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1`
  - **minor scales**
    - natural minor: `2 1 2 2 1 2 2`
    - harmonic minor: `2 1 2 2 1 3 1`
    - **melodic minor**
      - ascending: `2 1 2 2 2 2 1`
      - descending: same as harmonic

## Day 4. [Why Chord Progressions Work](https://youtu.be/bFY4Az15uKQ)

- a large part of music comes from the listener's expectation
  - anticipating what comes next, pattern recognition
- **tonal functions**
  - the 7 chords in a key can be split into 3 classes
  - **tonic**
    - usually "stability"
    - 1st, 3rd and 6th chords
  - **subdominant**
    - usually "departure"
    - 2nd and 4th chords
  - **dominant**
    - usually "tension"
    - 5th and 7th chords
  - most basic blueprint: tonic $\rightarrow$ subdominant $\rightarrow$ dominant

## Day 5. [Chord Voicing](https://youtu.be/VdEb2dABSeY)

- the same chord can be played with different octave and multiplicity of notes
  - this is the "voicing" of the chord
- often the lowest note is the root note of the chord, but free to experiment
- sometimes middle notes can even be left out in a voicing

## Day 6. [How Pentatonic Scales Work](https://youtu.be/71dDH_Q4Bjg)

- **pentatonic scale**
  - broad meaning: any scale that contains 5 notes
  - **major pentatonic scale**
    - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th notes of the major scale
  - **minor pentatonic scale**
    - 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th notes of the natural minor scale
  - **tonally complete**
    - you can make complete songs from just the notes in a pentatonic scale
    - good safety and stability when improvising
      - not always though
    - why? because they are stable notes in the diatonic/heptatonic scale
      - also makes it more boring if you overdo it
- **tonal stability**
  - stability of the notes in a diatonic/heptatonic scale
  - melodies are often pulled back towards these notes
  - the root / first / tonic note is the most stable in a major scale
    - followed by the 3rd and 5th notes
      - followed by the 2nd and 6th notes
        - least stable are 4th and 7th notes
          - because they are pulled to the 3 most stable notes (?)
          - therefore known as "leading" notes
          - apparently clashes with more stable notes when played together (?)
