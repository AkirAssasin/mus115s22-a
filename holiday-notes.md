# Holiday Notes

Notes from watching one YouTube video on music theory every day during the holidays.

## Day 1. [A Beginner's Guide to Music Theory](https://youtu.be/n2z02J4fJwg)

- **tempo**
  - tempo is measured in beats per minute (BPM)
  - time signature $\tfrac{a}{b}$ = 1 bar has $a$ beats of length $\tfrac{1}{b}$
    - I guess we'll find out the impact of this later on
- **notes**
  - a pitch and duration
  - `A4` is the note of `A` in octave 4
- **frequency**
  - depends on the tuning system used
  - modern western uses [12-tone equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament)
    - typically tuned to A440 (`A4` tuned to 440Hz)
- **octave**
  - an octave starts with `C`, has 12 semitones
  - 12-equal means each semitone is a $\sqrt[12]{2}$ step on a logarithmic scale
    - next note $f_{i + 1} = (\sqrt[12]{2})f_i$
    - next octave $f_{i + 12} = 2f_i$
- **scale**
  - common types: major and minor
  - has a root note
  - C major scale is a major scale with a root note of `C`
- **chords**
  - a group of notes played together
  - major triad: 1st, 3rd, 5th notes in the major scale
    - same with minor triads
  - adding $x$-th key to a triad makes it a $x$-th chord

## Day 2. [How Chord Progressions Work](https://youtu.be/fCNuaubi95Q)

- **chords**
  - can be major (`K`), minor (`k`) or diminished (`k°`)
  - tonal function based on the key they exist in
  - the 7 notes of the key's scale form the 7 chords
    - **key of `K` major:** `K = I`, `ii`, `iii`, `IV`, `V`, `vi`, `vii°`
    - **key of `k` minor:** `k = i`, `ii°`, `III`, `iv`, `v`, `VI`, `VII`
