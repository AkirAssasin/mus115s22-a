# Holiday Notes

Notes from watching one YouTube video on music theory every day during the holidays.
*(Formatting: do not delete stuff from previous days, cross them out instead.)*

## Day 1. [A Beginner's Guide to Music Theory](https://youtu.be/n2z02J4fJwg)

- **tempo**
  - tempo is measured in beats per minute (BPM)
  - time signature $\tfrac{a}{b}$ = 1 bar has $a$ beats of length $\tfrac{1}{b}$
    - I guess we'll find out the impact of this later on
- **notes**
  - a pitch and duration
  - `A4` is the note of `A` in octave 4
- **frequency**
  - depends on the tuning system used
  - modern western uses [12-tone equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament)
    - typically tuned to A440 (`A4` tuned to 440Hz)
- **octave**
  - an octave starts with `C`, has 12 semitones
  - 12-equal means each semitone is a $\sqrt[12]{2}$ step on a logarithmic scale
  - jumping one octave up = doubling frequency
- **scale**
  - common types: major and minor
  - has a root note
  - C major scale is a major scale with a root note of `C`
- **chords**
  - a group of notes played together
  - major triad: 1st, 3rd, 5th notes in the major scale
    - same with minor triads
  - adding $x$-th key to a triad makes it a $x$-th chord
