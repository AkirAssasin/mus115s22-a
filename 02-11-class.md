# 02-11 Class

## Mid-terms

- 10 questions
- things like "what is a melody" or "what is sound design"
- go read the moodle slides

## Intervals

- melodic vs. harmonic
  - **melodic:** two tones in succession
  - **harmonic:** two tones simultaneously
- classification
  - **numerical:** 1, 2, ..., 8 (in steps)
  - **names:** unison (a.k.a. prime), second, third, ..., seventh, octave
  - **compound:** more than an octave
    - extensions of simple intervals (e.g. 9th = 2th + 7th)
  - **D** for **diminished:**
    - a half-step smaller
    - e.g. diminished 4th is a 3.5th
  - **A** for **augmented:**
    - a half-step larger
    - e.g. augmented 4th is a 4.5th
- quality
  - there's a chart on moodle for this
  - **P** for **perfect:**
    - does not need resolution (is the resolution)
    - 1st, 4th, 5th, 8ths
    - group $I$ intervals
  - **M** for **Major** and **m** and **minor**
  - inverting intervals maintain the quality
    - i.e. moving the lower note one octave higher
    - the interval naming and number will change

## Form

- **standard song form**
  - optional intro
  - verse (typically double)
  - chorus
  - verse (typically double)
  - bridge / middle 8 (usually 8 bars)
  - double chorus
  - optional outro
- **modern standard song form**
  - standard song form influenced by modern dance
  - instead of double verse, it has verse and pre-chorus
  - longer bridge for drops and silences
- **rock music**
  - solo / break / ride after, or replacing the bridge
- **variations**
  - post-chorus
- **strophic form**
  - same melody (A-A-A-...) with optionally different lyrics
  - e.g. the two verses in standard song form
  - also other forms such as ternary (A-B-A) and etc. in the slides

## Chords / Chord Progressions

- next week

## Assignment

- use musescore to compose something using melodic and harmonic intervals
  - at least 16 (?) bars, no melody required
  - sorry I'm also lost just read the rubrics I guess
  - the stuff you make here will be like a palette to use in DAW later, don't go too ham
- export as MIDI into DAW of choice, select instruments
- build a 45-second loop as the background track for a video of a DigiPen game called Qubie Reloaded
  - note: the video speed on youtube is doubled
  - make sure you match the music with the non-doubled version
    - e.g. pro tools lets you put videos in the track to sync it
  - cut, layer and arrange your MIDI loop from musescore into proper BGM
- vuk's opinions
  - (did he say this?) don't go too hard on percussion and melody because it is a puzzle game
  - electronic instruments are easier to fit the graphics
  - use some form too (vuk's example is A(ab) B(cc))
  - use snap to bar / beats in your DAW
  - reverb "tails" after the end of your loop can be cut and pasted to the beginning
- after exporting the loop, reimport it back to make sure it loops
