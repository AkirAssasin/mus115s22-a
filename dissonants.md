# Dissonant Intervals

- auxillary notes (do re do) (dissonant re)
- 4/4 "safe zones" are 1, 3, 2, then least safe is 4 (because goes to 1)
  - it's nicer to play dissonants in non-safe zones
- anticipation notes (next chord have, but current chord is dissonant)
- passing notes (do re mi) (dissonant re)
  - "walking up" / "walking down" to the next chord
- off-beat resolution vs. on-beat resolution
  - resolution i.e. return to a stable note
  - on-beat resolution is usually stronger
